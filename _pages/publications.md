## 📝 Current Status  

At present, I do not have peer-reviewed publications. My research work so far has been carried out during my Master's degree and early career, laying the groundwork for future publications.  

- My M.A. dissertation (*“Sentiment Analysis and Evaluation on Twitter Data by Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms”*) produced results that can be further developed into publishable work.  
- Ongoing exploration in **machine learning, NLP, public opinion analysis, and applied AI** is expected to generate publishable findings during my PhD studies.

✨ This section will be updated as new research outputs are published. Stay tuned for future work!
